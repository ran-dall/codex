# Contribution Guidelines


## Goals of this List
* Quality over quantity, i.e. do not add every single framework under the sun
* The frameworks should have a certain maturity and popularity
* Do not add projects that don't have an issue tracker or version control


## Contributing

* Fork the repository
* Add your suggestion
  * Use the template below
  * Choose the appropriate category
  * Sorting should be done roughly by numbers of stars (or importance)
* Create a pull request

```

Note that there are two whitespaces after the first line to enforce a line break.

Adding links to the demo or documentation is optional, but you should add them if they are explicitly provided by the framework.
The last line is used to add information about what CSS preprocessors (if any) are used by the framework. For example, if something only uses CSS, add `#CSS`. If a framework uses CSS, Sass, and Stylus, add `#CSS #Sass #Stylus`.
